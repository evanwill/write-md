# Academic Writing

- "what you see is not what you get"
- proprietary tools and formats 
- separation of content/semantics and style
    - spend less time formatting, more time writing
    - structure content as data = powerful
    - version control GitHub
- "markup" languages
    - simple - don't waste time in complex and frustrating formatting in Word that will be deleted by publishers anyway. This keeps your distractions to a minimum.
    - sharable - any device can open and read plaintext, no special software needed, unlike Word.
    - preservable / sustainable - markdown is plaintext which is easy for digital preservation, unlike Word.
    - version controllable - you can use the full power of Git or other version control systems, unlike Word.

# Markdown

- flavors
- editors
- vs. LaTeX

2004 [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (original spec Daring Fireball / John Gruber) w/ Aaron Swartz

Markdown is human readable as plain text–it is intuitive like writing an email. However, it is designed to render as HTML. Markdown compilers are built in to many applications (like the editors above) to generate formatted versions such as HTML, .docx, or PDF.
Markdown is [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text), it’s sort of like source code for your document. You can write it in any application that supports plain text, i.e. a text editor. When working with code you should have a good text editor.

Markdown is a quick and simple way to write formatted documents in plaintext.
It is intuitive and easy to read, but is designed to convert to HTML for easy web publishing.
Writing in plaintext rather than [proprietary](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.en.html) formats such as Word has many advantages:


[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a standard to simplify writing content for the web. 
[GitHub markdown flavor](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) can be used any where on GitHub and in Jekyll.
